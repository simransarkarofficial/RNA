This project is a basic "Face Detection" project which uses OpenCV and WebCam for functioning.

This project uses pretrained Haar Cascade Classifier of frontal face to recognize the face, and then uses a bounding box to show the user the desired output. 

Face Detection is a common template for different Computer Vision projects, for example face tilt recognition, faces recognition,
